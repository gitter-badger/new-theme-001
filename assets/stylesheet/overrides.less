/**
 * Overriding default behaviors
 *
 * {name-of-project}-Overrides enables you to override various default components and behaviors.
 * This system consists of two major points:
 * Overriding {name-of-project}'s own behavior in order to target a specific
 * section of the required components.
 * Overriding the visible parts of stylesheet so that the
 * themes can adapt better to them.
